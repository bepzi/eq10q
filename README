EQ10Q LV2 Plugin
-----------------

EQ10Q is an audio plugin over the LV2 standard (http://lv2plug.in) implementing
a powerfull and flexible parametric equalizer, currently in development.
The goal is to create an equalizer plugin that includes parametric
equalization with diferent filter types like peaking, HPF, LPF, Shelving and Notch
with IIR and FIR algorithms and a nice GUI displaying the equalization curve.

At the moment we have implemented second order biquadratic filters (Peaking, Low Shelving,
High Shelving and Notch), and configurable order (1, 2, 3, 4) HPF and LPF filters.
All with IIR algorithms. And a GUI writed with Gtkmm (http://www.gtkmm.org) to control 
all the parameters and display the curve using plotmm (http://plotmm.sourceforge.net).
The plugin is over LV2 standard and writed in C++ with lv2-C++-tools 
(http://ll-plugins.nongnu.org/hacking.html) provided by Lars Luthman.

EQ10Q is hosted at http://eq10q.sourceforge.net/
Main developer: Pere Ràfols Soler (sapista2@gmail.com)

Installation
------------
EQ10Q plugin will be installed into /usr/local/lib/lv2 acording the Makefile.
Please don't change the installation prefix (INSTALL_DIR) in the Makefile, 
otherwise EQ10Q won't be able to load some of the GUI components.

Before install EQ10Q you must resolve all of required libraries:
  - G++ compiler
  - pkg-config
  - Gtkmm >= 2.4
  - PlotMM >= 0.1.2 (Debian doesn't include it, you must compile from source)
  - lv2-C++-tools (Most distributions doesn't include it, you must compile from source)
  - pstreams (Gentoo doesn't include it, you must get the header file from http://pstreams.sourceforge.net)

To install EQ10Q in your system open a terminal, go to EQ10Q folder and just type:
 
  make

If make finish successfully type the following as root

  make install

To run EQ10Q you need a LV2 host. I recomend Ardour (<= 2.8.3) http://ardour.org
