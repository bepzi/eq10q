EQ10Q Project Developent road map for version 2
==========================================================================

TODO list:
- Split all files in gui folder in diferents files, any class needs its own file
- Add the following directives to all headers files 
	#ifndef foo 
		#define foo 
		
	#endif 
- Update all files in gui folder acording new GUI needs and improve coding structure
	
===============================================================================
New ideas for the future:

	=based on: http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/lv2-extensions-good
	* LV2 Instance Access (http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/instance-access) - Defines
   a method for plugin UIs to get a direct handle to an LV2 plugin instance
   (LV2_Handle), if possible. ==> With this we can reduce the number of LV2 ports to only Gain,Freq and Q.
	The idea is that filter type, filter on.off, VU etc... aren´t knowed by host. Only port that can be automated will be konown by the host.
	
	* LV2 MIDI Events (http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/midi) - Defines an LV2 event
   type for standard raw MIDI. ==> with this we can control EQ10Q with a MIDI control surface
   
   * LV2 Presets (http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/presets) - Defines presets (e.g.
   named sets of control values) for LV2 plugins. ==> Better implementation of save,load plugin presets
   
   * LV2 UI (http://lv2plug.in/ns/extensions/ui) - Defines an interface that
   can be used in LV2 plugins and hosts to create UIs for plugins.==> An extension for plugin GUI
